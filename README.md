## SQL Queries Explained

The analysis is built on several key SQL queries:

### 1. Total Global Cases and Deaths
Calculates global totals and the death percentage:

```sql
SELECT 
  SUM(new_cases) AS total_cases,
  SUM(CAST(new_deaths AS INT)) AS total_deaths,
  SUM(CAST(new_deaths AS INT)) / SUM(new_cases) * 100 AS DeathPercentage
FROM PortfolioProject..CovidDeaths
WHERE continent IS NOT NULL

### Key Insights
The global death percentage is approximately (fill from your data)%.
Country (fill from your data) has the highest total death count.
Country (fill from your data) has the highest percentage of population infected.
Countries with strong vaccination rollout show noticeable drops in infection rates over time.

**Tableau Dashboard
The interactive dashboard visualizes:

Global total cases and deaths

Death percentage by continent

Top 10 countries by death count

Percent of population infected per country
